Day 1 Assignment
Q1. What is your understanding of Blockchain?
Ans- Blockchain is about enabling peer to peer transaction in a decentralized network, Establishing trust among unknown peers, Recording the transaction in immutable distributed ledger .

Q2. What is the core problem blockchain trying to solve?
The core problems in Blockchain:
1)Block chain can be slow while Transactions can take a while to process when
the user number increases
2) Authenticity
3) Security
4) Organization must determine which transactions or interactions the blockchain should capture and who should have access to which portions.
i.e Need of third party trust

Q3. What are the few features which blockchain will give u?
Features of a Blockchain:
1)Verifiable
2)Unchanged
3)Tamper-Proof
4)Immutable
5)Transparency

Q4. What all things does a Block Contain?
Ans : Blockchain contains:
1)Number of Transactions
2)Transaction Fees
3)Nonce
4)Previous Block Hash Value
5)Gas Used
6)Gas Limit
7)Mining Key


Q5. How is the verifiability of Blockchain is been attained ?
Verifiability can be attained by
Genesis Block /Block 1
0 + new data = Fingerprint 1

Block 2
Fingerprint 1 + new data = Fingerprint 2

and this chain continues.

If someone change the data then fingerprint value/Hash value also change , so it is not match the Original Hash Value present in the Next Block , i.e Block 2
